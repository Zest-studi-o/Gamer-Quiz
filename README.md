how the website can help users meet their needs.

Project goals:
- To encourage people to take the gamer quiz.
- To let users select different levels of difficulty.
- To provide users with feedback so that they know what they have gotten wrong and to learn the correct answer.
- To allow the users to save their scores and appear on the leaderboard to make it more competitive and appealing to play.

### User Stories

#### First-Time Visitor Goals

## Design

### Colour Scheme
The site colour palette is based on a technological theme so it could be associated with video games, this colour palette was created using coolors website.

![Content](docs/colour-palette.png)

### Typography
For the logo I have used a vector illustration that I customised and exported as a png with transparent background.
I picked a display font for the headings that are related to the quiz theme which is a video game named Press Start 2P and then for the body copy a readable sans serif, optimal for web design such as Montserrat.
The fonts were taken from Google Fonts:

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat)
- [Press Start 2P](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P)

### Imagery

The images are taken from the royalty-free sites credited [here](#Credits).

### Features Left to Implement

In the future, I would like to:

- Add a multiplayer version to the game.
- Store data in back-end.
- Add music to the quiz.
- Give a summary of the questions and the correct answers.
- Add a feature in which the player can select the number of questions.

### Accessibility

It is important to have a website that is accessibility friendly, this objective was achieved by:

- Ensuring that images have an alt attribute.
- Using aria labels.
- Using semantic html.
- Making sure that background and foreground colours have high contrast, after an error returned in the nav bar by the lighthouse validator the background colour darkness was increased to contrast higher with the white color applied to the font, the logo also has a drop shadow to enhance visibility and the clickable menu for mobile screens uses a visible font size.
- Using a sans serif font is recommended for web design which is easy to read.

### Code Used

- [Modals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH5OW46yO8I) - I used this video tutorial to help me with the modal windows.

- [Build a Quiz App - James Q Quick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u98ROZjBWy8&list=PLDlWc9AfQBfZIkdVaOQXi1tizJeNJipEx&index=1) I used this series of videos to teach me how to make a quiz app using html, css and js.
This tutorial builds upon the Code Institute content, teaching how to develop and add features to a QUIZ app, such as a high scores page or save user data to local storage, the tutorial goes further and also explains how to fetch data from an API to display the questions.

- I also used [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) to troubleshoot errors, [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and [mdn developer](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/) to read documentation and learn about specific things such as how to fetch.

### Content

All questions were pulled from the following API:
