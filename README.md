### Features

#### Existing Features
General features.

### Features Left to Implement

In the future, I would like to:

- Add a multiplayer version to the game.

### Accessibility

It is important to have a website that is accessibility friendly, this objective was achieved by:

- Ensuring that images have an alt attribute.
- Using aria labels.
- Using semantic html.
- Making sure that background and foreground colours have high contrast, after an error returned in the nav bar by the lighthouse validator the background colour darkness was increased to contrast higher with the white color applied to the font, the logo also has a drop shadow to enhance visibility and the clickable menu for mobile screens uses a visible font size.
- Using a sans serif font is recommended for web design which is easy to read.
